Welcome to the marvel app exercise


For this project I decide to use MVVM as architecture and decided to use the
use case patern becuase is the native architecture for android.

Also used flow as programing reactive data combined with kotling coroutine also
because is the native solution for kotlin and the same for local store with room.

I create some test as example of how to do it with coroutine and flow.

For dependency injection I used Dagger2 becuase is the most extended library, and
I wanted to learn how to do it correct with viewmodels.
